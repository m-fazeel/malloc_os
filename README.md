# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the `make` file 

## Building the Library
To build the library, navigate to the top-level directory and type:
```
make
```
# Usage
Once you have the library, you can use it to override the existing `malloc` by using `LD_PRELOAD`.

For example, to run the `ffnf` test using the First Fit shared library:
```
$ env LD_PRELOAD=lib/libmalloc-ff.so tests/ffnf
```
To run the other heap management schemes, replace `libmalloc-ff.so` with the appropriate library:

- Best-Fit: `libmalloc-bf.so`
- First-Fit: `libmalloc-ff.so`
- Next-Fit: `libmalloc-nf.so`
- Worst-Fit: `libmalloc-wf.so`

# Features
This library implements the following features:


1. **Splitting and coalescing of free blocks:** If two free blocks are adjacent, then the library combines them. If a free block is larger than the requested size, then the library splits the block into two.
2. **Different heap management strategies:** The library supports four different heap management strategies - Next Fit, Worst Fit, Best Fit, and First Fit.
3. **Detailed tracking:** The library keeps track of several events:
    - Number of times malloc is called successfully
    - Number of times free is called successfully
    - Number of times an existing block is reused
    - Number of times a new block is requested
    - Number of times a block is split
    - Number of times blocks are coalesced
    - Number of blocks in the free list
    - Total amount of memory requested
    - Maximum size of the heap
